## ZPM Explorer
A graphic interface to explorer the applications inside InterSystems Package Manager.

## Description
ZPM Explorer's idea is to make it easier for people to find out what ZPM offers. Every week, every day, a new app joins the ZPM world, so why not help developers and non-developers take advantage of this incredible world?!

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) and [Docker desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) installed.

## Installation 
Clone/git pull the repo into any local directory
```
$ git clone https://github.com/diashenrique/zpm-explorer.git
```

Open the terminal in this directory and run:

```
$ docker-compose build
```

3. Run the IRIS container with your project:

```
$ docker-compose up -d
```
